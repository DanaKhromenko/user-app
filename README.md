# User Authentication

The project aims to implement user authentication functionality in a system using MySQL as the database.
This involves designing and implementing a secure login system that verifies user credentials and grants access only to authorized users.
Additionally, the system will maintain user sessions.

The project aims to demonstrate the ability to work with **Unit tests**, **JUnit 5**, **Mockito**, and **Hibernate**.
